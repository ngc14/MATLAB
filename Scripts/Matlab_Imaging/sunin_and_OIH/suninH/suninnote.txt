* Need have 'ivf' files available in location (e.g. 050401rat\run0\blkavg\singlecond\*.ivf)
* Assume only one set of single-condition ivf files in that directory.
* NStim will depends on the number of ivf files in that directory.
* stim() in 'suninuser' no longer useful.
* Stim order is the order of 'ivf' file name. 
* sum frame range is not applicable 
* operation is not applicable
* super pixel is not applicable
* flagmap is set to 1 (only save block averaged subtraction map)
* Following parameters still applicable
	* clipping
	* filtering
	* vector?
